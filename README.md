# Omacase

Turn a fresh MacOs installation into a fully-configured, beautiful, and modern web development system by running a single command. That's the one-line pitch for Omacase. No need to write bespoke configs for every essential tool just to get started or to be up on all the latest command-line tools. Omacase is an opinionated take on what MacOs can be at its best.

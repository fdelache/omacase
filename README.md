# Omacase

Turn a fresh MacOs installation into a fully-configured, beautiful, and modern development system by running a single command. That's the one-line pitch for Omacase. No need to write bespoke configs for every essential tool just to get started or to be up on all the latest command-line tools. Omacase is an opinionated take on what MacOs can be at its best.

This is a fork of [Omakub](https://omakub.org/) adapted to the MacOs and its zsh shell. A lot of the tooling included in Omakub is not yet included in Omacase, as this is a work in progress.

# Installation

Run the following to install Omacase for the first time
```
curl -sSL https://franck.isalazy.dev/omacase/install | zsh
```

# Usage
Once Omacase has been installed, you can configure it using the `omacase` command.
